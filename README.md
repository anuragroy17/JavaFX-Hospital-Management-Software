<ul>
<li>While working on the JavaFX project, I learned how to connect to a mysql dbms through JDBC.</li>

<li>Implemented different solutions to make the app robust and efficient.</li>

# Future Implementation:
I will be adding a new table of old patients in my hospital database so that when a patient presses "Yes" his data will be saved in it, even though the doctor can delete the current patient from his/her list.
